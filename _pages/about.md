My digital legacy...

## 👋 About Me

I’m **Dr. Fulong Li**, a Power Electronics Engineer and Researcher currently working in the UK. 
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Aston University, and I’m an IEEE Member with deep expertise in advanced converter design, control strategies, and energy systems integration.

## 💼 Professional Focus

My work spans across:
- AI-assisted optimal design of power electronic converters (DAB, Buck/Boost)
- Characterisation and thermal modelling of wide-bandgap semiconductors (SiC/GaN)
- Control and stability of DC microgrids
- Real-time energy management system (EMS) design

---

## 🔬 Research Vision

I’m passionate about combining **power electronics**, **AI-assisted optimisation**, and **energy systems** to build more sustainable, efficient, and intelligent electrical infrastructures. My research contributions include:
- Developing high-performance converter prototypes
- Innovating control algorithms for distributed energy systems
- Publishing journal and conference papers in IEEE/IET

---

## 🌍 Global Experience

I've had the privilege to work and collaborate across multiple countries and institutions, including:
- 🇬🇧 UK (Aston University, Loughborough University, Cardiff University)
- 🇨🇦 University of Waterloo
- 🇨🇳 Zhejiang University
- 🇳🇱 DC Systems BV, TU Delft

---

## ✨ Beyond Work

Outside of engineering, I enjoy creative writing and have drafted several science-fiction novels. I’m fascinated by the intersection of technology, storytelling, and society.
