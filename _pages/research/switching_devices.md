## üí° Overview

Switching devices are the foundation of modern power electronics. Key technologies include:

- **IGBTs (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors)** for medium-to-high voltage applications
- **SiC MOSFETs** for high-efficiency, high-frequency power converters
- **GaN HEMTs** for ultra-fast switching and compact system design
