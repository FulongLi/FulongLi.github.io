## ðŸ§  Overview

This section covers the layered control strategies used in modern microgrids:

- Primary control (droop, V/f)
- Secondary control (voltage restoration)
- Tertiary control (power flow optimisation)

## ðŸ§ª Research Contributions

### 1. Decentralised Droop Control Improvements
- Adaptive droop gains
- Power sharing under mismatched conditions

### 2. Secondary Restoration Algorithms
- Distributed consensus-based controllers
- Time-delay and robustness analysis

### 3. Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Strategies
- Synchronisation and mode switching
