## 📝 WiPDA 2024 – Cardiff, UK

I attended the **IEEE WiPDA 2024** (Workshop on Wide Bandgap Power Devices and Applications) held in Cardiff, UK.  
This conference provided an excellent opportunity to catch up on the **latest developments in SiC and GaN device applications** in power electronics.

### 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Advanced packaging and thermal management for SiC modules
- Reliability testing and qualification strategies for GaN HEMTs
- Emerging trends in high-frequency, high-efficiency converters
- Integration of WBG devices into traction and aerospace systems

### 🤝 Networking & Collaboration:
It was great to connect with researchers, engineers, and companies working on cutting-edge power devices. I had insightful discussions with specialists from both academia and industry.

> 🧠 Takeaway: SiC and GaN are moving rapidly toward mainstream adoption — especially in high-performance, space- and weight-constrained systems.
