## ðŸ“Œ Poster Presentation
I attended the **IEEE PEAC 2022** (Power Electronics and Application Conference) virtually, where I presented our review work on a niche yet impactful topic â€” **DC bus signalling** within microgrid systems.

Our findings were shared during the poster session. The poster PDF is embedded below:
