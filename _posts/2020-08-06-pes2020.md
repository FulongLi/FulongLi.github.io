Keywords: Online Oral Presentation


## ðŸ§¾ Summary

I attended the **IEEE PES General Meeting 2020**, where I delivered an **online verbal presentation** on:

> **"Energy Management System for DC Microgrids Considering Battery Degradation"**

This research was conducted in collaboration with **Prof. Claudio A. CaÃ±izares** (University of Waterloo).  
It explores the integration of **battery aging models** into real-time EMS algorithms to improve operational reliability and long-term performance in DC microgrid environments.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- EMS design using **GAMS** and **MATLAB/Yalmip**
- Integrated **battery degradation modelling**
- Applied to DC microgrid test scenarios
- Focus on **lifecycle-aware scheduling and optimisation**
