Summary: Online Verbal Presentation

I attended the **IEEE PES General Meeting 2020**, where I presented my work on:

> **"Energy Management System for DC Microgrids Considering Battery Degradation"**

This research was conducted in collaboration with **Prof. Claudio A. Cañizares** from the University of Waterloo and explored how battery aging models can be integrated into real-time energy management systems to improve long-term system performance.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- EMS design using **GAMS** and MATLAB
- Focused on **battery degradation modelling**
- Application to DC microgrid environments
- Scenario-based performance evaluation
